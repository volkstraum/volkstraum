### About Volkstraum
Volkstraum is a mnemonic of my Chinese name, Sifan (思凡). 思 denotes thought, while 凡 gestures toward both the ordinary and the extraordinary. The tension between these ideas has shaped my thinking throughout my life. Only through interdisciplinary study across philosophy, art, and computation have I come to understand this contradiction not as something to resolve, but as something to inhabit.

My name demands the duty to preserve what has been eroded: the productive tension between opposing ideas and the value that emerges from holding them together. Volkstraum exists as an attempt to give form to this responsibility. It reflects a desire to live up to the name I was given, the name I have interpreted, and the name I ought to embody
